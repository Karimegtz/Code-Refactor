# Code-Refactor

## Description

This project involves refactoring an existing website to improve its accessibility and optimization for search engines. The goal is to ensure that the HTML code adheres to accessibility standards and that the site is better structured and organized.

## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines



## Project Structure

- **index.html**: Contains the main HTML structure of the website. Semantic elements have been implemented to enhance accessibility and SEO.
- **style.css**: CSS stylesheet, reorganized and consolidated to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements. Comments have been added to facilitate code maintenance.
- **script.js**: JavaScript file with improved code organization, ensuring that all functions related to user interaction are clearly defined and documented.

## Improvements Made

- Replaced non-semantic HTML elements with semantic elements (such as `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, etc.).
- Added descriptive `alt` attributes to all images to improve accessibility.
- Reorganized heading tags (`h1`, `h2`, etc.) to follow a logical, sequential order.
- Modified the document title to be more concise and descriptive.
- Reviewed and corrected the CSS code structure to follow best practices and improve efficiency.
